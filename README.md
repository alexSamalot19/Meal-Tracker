# Meal Tracker

<br>

## Description

Meal Tracker is a command line interface which will take terminal input a users 
meal and provide calorie information. Foods in meals will be broken up into 
food pyramid categories in order to determine the number of "well balanced"
meals. Meals can contain any number of foods and the aim is to balance
a users caloric input with their percentage of well balanced meals. 
This CLI will also be re-purposed as back end functionality

## Run Instructions

The final version will prompt a users name, the meals they have eaten and 
nutritional information on each food. This will be similar to the web application 
where a React front end will provide a user interface.
